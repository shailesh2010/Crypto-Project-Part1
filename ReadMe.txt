The executable was created using g++ compiler 4.2.1 on Mac OS (El Capitan).

The executable expects loads the dictionaries during run time and expects them to be in the same directory as the executable. If there is a problem in loading the dictionaries, an error message is shown. In such case, kindly check dictionary files location and names.

please contact any of the authors in case you face any issues in running the executable.

IF you are trying to run this on windows, you will need to compile the code again using a windows compatible compiler. Please ensure that the dictionaries are in the same folder as the executable. By default, Windows runs executables from a different folder than one in which the file resides.
